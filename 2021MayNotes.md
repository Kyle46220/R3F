Hello!

I'm back. My goal is to try to do at least an hour of coding nearly everyday to get this thing Built!

Its all coming back to me very quick;y. I was worried I'd forgottenit. Some things are even obviouser.

I'm looking at the the drawer loader.

First Goal - trying to make drawer clickable off. from drawer array in store.
Second Goal - to position drawers based on updateable from sliders

calls to store cause re-renders
when to call from store and when to pass down props

I want to scale a model based on the assembly.
