## Hello!

# its been a while since i've done some coding as work has been intense with mvoing and stuff. BUt I'm back baby.

Ive just strated up again trying to figure out the cabinet configurator.

Have jumped back in with the gltfJSX loader. I've just figured out how to get multiple models to load froim an array.

I had an error for ages. i forgot that you have to return a JSX object in a functional component in react.

Now it works.

THe next task is to get on onClick event to manifest a drawer in the clicked zone. i had used raycasting in the plain three.js version but now I think i can juste put an onclick event handler straight in the JSX mesh object.

click handler changes state and then state is updated on main component re-render.

ok good hustle. Tonight I achieved drawer models being loaded when I click on the shelf. And then they disappear when they are clicked on. I made some click handling functions that called the state function which updated the drawer position. next I need to make it some that the drawer position updated when the sliders are updated. And then I need to make it so that they are in the right spot and the right bounding dimensions.

I think I'm going to need to build some scaffold invisible bounding boxes in between the empty spaces of the shelves and divs. These will then become the clickable boxes.

i need to make it so that the drawer state is updated with the sliders as well. Where should I keep this in the state object? Maybe I will Load IN a new shelf Model? Bu this is hard. maybe I load in panels? but what's the point. maybe there would be a point when the model is more complex.

Ok starting to get lost in the spaghetti but I think i"m still making progress. Everything is continuing to make some more sense. today I was trying to update positions of the drawers that have been clicked on. Its weird because I've got a state object that renderrs components that renders the meshes, but I wonder if there's a more sensible way to do this. sometimes I feel like ive got two parallel worlds of my state object and the actual 3d object and I want them to just be one.

been a week or two. trying to figure out where i was up to. I have an inlking i was think about x state last time.

tryna get the drawers to update their positions on width change. There will be a simple solution. I have been rendering components from the state object. I think this is like the state machine type thing and I thinks its good.

I think though that i'm creating a lot of objects rather than moving the positions when I update the state.drawers.pos. i want to know a way to calculate total of all scene children.
const { scene } = useThree();
console.log(
'scene',
scene.children.map((item) =>
item.children.map((i) => i.children.map((x) => x.children.length))
)
);

ok so maybe i'm not creating lots of objects because there were no blowouts in the children.length .mapping. i think this is ok because all the componenets re-render on slider change. like the whole cabinet.

I think next i will have to make a grid. is it a matrix? i've got the shelves coords and the divs coords. will the most sensible unit be the row? I think I will need to make the bounding box thing again .

something fucky is going on about the order of rendering drawers v shelves.

I'm looking at the original R3F demo with the cubes https://codesandbox.io/s/rrppl0y8l4?file=/src/App.js and they just use component state for the clickability. There's a reason this isn't enough and I think its when you add the sliders and stuff in?

so here's some challenges i could maybe add to the sandbox?

-   put a slider in that controls something.
-   put some panels into the box.
-   load a model into the sandbox.

there's a few challenges

-   making the drawers disappear when clicked.
-   making the drawers moved when slidden.

Rather than making the drawers disappear when they're clicked. maybe i should just make the cavity clickable then it can just toggle through drawer, cuboard etc? this would be a good way to record state?

I've got some isues with state updating for the drawer positions. They've stopped working when I click on the shelves now. I got the woking wasily a while ago, but now they've stopped. The issue seems to be that the state object is updating but not going back to the store the refresh happens intantly with the shelf updates, but not with the drwer updates. Did I have a similar problem with the height and width? where the width would only later update when the heigth did? How did i fix this?

the problem is that the drawers state is only being updated when the slider change handler is being called, and not when the onscreen sclick handler is being called.

so the component the hook is in re-renders if state is accessed with the hook. on re-render of build, drawer fill will work. so put the adjust drawers hook in the build hook and then make sure it is called when you want the component to update.

But it can't seem to see why this isn't working based on this. I'm going to move on to the bounding boxes because i can't seem to find this bug.
